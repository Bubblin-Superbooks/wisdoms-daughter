Read the seal of Noot, high-priest and prophet, and tarry not.”</p><p>I read and hid away the roll. Then I asked,</p><p>“Upon what wings do we fly to Noot who is so far from us, friend Philo?”</p><p>“Upon those of a ship that is known to you, Prophetess, the ship named <em>Hapi</em>, upon which already you have passed many perils. She lies yonder fully manned in the outer fringe of this sea of reeds.”</p><p>“How did you find those reeds, and how did you know that I was hidden among them?” I asked curiously.</p><p>“Noot marked them on a chart he gave me and told me that in them, where, as the story runs, Isis discovered the heart of Osiris, there I should find the child of Isis. Prophetess, inquire no more.”</p></div> </div>
