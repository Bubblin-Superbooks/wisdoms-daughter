She raced upon our beam not a spear’s cast away. I stood upon the high poop of the <em>Hapi</em> and saw it all, for the old Arab blood was on fire in me, as it had been when I charged in the battle where my father fell, and I would play no woman’s part. Moreover, my spirit told me that I had not escaped from the hands of Tenes and out of the burning hell of Sidon, to die there upon the sea.</p></div> </div>
