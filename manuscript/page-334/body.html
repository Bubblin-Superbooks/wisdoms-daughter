Did <em>you</em> ever suffer from this eternal curse which Nature lays on men and women because she would not die? Did <em>you</em> ever take the bribe of sweet madness with which she baits her hook? Or, as once I think you told me in bygone years, were you always holy and apart?”</p><p>He covered his eyes with those thin hands, then answered,</p><p>“I was young. I suffered from that curse. Whatever I may have said to you in the past when you were but a child, I gorged that bait, not once but many times, and I have paid the price. Because I have paid it to my ruin, I pray you whom I love not to empty your heart of its purest virgin gold and fill the void with pain and penitence. Easy is it to fall, Daughter, but hard, very hard to rise again. Will you not swear?”</p></div> </div>
