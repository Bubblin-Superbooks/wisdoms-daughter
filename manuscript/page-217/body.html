<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">knowing that these are the same God whose hands hold all things.</p><p>Thus I sum up the matter. At least through the millions of the ages and the multitudes of lives man may attain to freedom if his face be set that way of his own desire. Yet in his little hour on the earth, that falsely he believes his all, looking from birth to death and the blackness that bounds them both, he is not free but a part of Strengths that are greater than his own. Have I, Ayesha, been free, I who chose the holy path and fell from it into Natureâ€™s gulfs? Did I desire to fall? Did I not desire to climb that steep road to the heights of Heaven and sit enthroned upon the topmost snows of purity and peace? And yet another Might hurled me thence and now it is my fate to climb again; by slow and painful steps to climb eternally.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">But of these things I will speak in their season, telling what is the price those pay who seek to overleap</p></div> </div>
